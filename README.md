## Introduction
In this work we aim to perform exploratory data analysis with the [Age dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imoore/age-dataset).

In order to achieve this goal we will perform several steps:
1. Data Preprocessing; cleaning and completing missing data.
2. Combining the data set with additional sources; Wikipedia, twitter and more.
3. Data Visualization.
